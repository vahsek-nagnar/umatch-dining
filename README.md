## About UMatch Dining:

UMatch Dining is a web application in which UMass diners can rate and review the various culinary options offered at the four Dining Halls. In depth personalized statistics will be offered to account holders.

## How to use:

The reviews of food items are available for everyone to view, but individually catered information and the posting of reviews require an account to be made. The site was designed to be intuitive and user friendly, so it should not be difficult to navigate.
